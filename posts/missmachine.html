	<h1>My Opinion on Miss Machine - The Dillinger Escape Plan</h1>
	<p>When I first heard The Dillinger Escape Plan, I was captivated by their different style of alternative metal, resembling sounds from industrial and other bands I listened to,
	such as System of a Down. In particular, I was very fond of some of their most popular songs, such as Milk Lizard and Symptons of Terminall Illness. I was recently compelled to listen
	to their albums in a more organized fashion, starting with Ire Works (2007).</p>
	<p>Many songs in it reinforced my taste for the band, with special mention to Dead as History and Mouth of Ghosts. Though their gutural, abrasive and aggressive vocals stood out in a
	manner unlike what I've heard before, the more subtle elements of their songs are what drove me to keep listening to them. The main example is the entire progression of Mouth of Ghosts,
	which enthralls me still.</p>
	<p> A progression which appeared to me most natural was to then follow up my list with Miss Machine (2004). Even though my enjoyment of it cannot be compared to that of Ire Works (at least
in the present moment), the experience of listening to it was enlightening on many aspescts. The first, and most obvious, are the new songs that I can now add to my musical repertoire, and a
reinforcement of my likeness for the band. The second, which seems rather counterintuitive given the general theme of the album, is my newfound perception that I am not particularly moved by
gutural and raspy vocals in their most general setting, and without other musical elements that emphasize their impact. This was evident for me in tracks like the opener, Panasonic Youth, and
Van Damsel.</p>
	<p>However, I now have a clearer picture in my mind of the general sonic elements that contribute to my enjoyment of these vocals in their songs and in songs from other bands, such as Gojira, Mastodon and SOAD.
	They are often accompanied by a thematic counterpoint in tamer vocals, in chorus progressions or in a very experimental manner. The songs in the album that appealed to me the most were the ones that either broke
	from these direct themes (but not from the overarching thematic choices of the album) such as Phone Home, those songs that managed to interweave sublime transistions and briges, such as Highway Robbery, or maybe
	just those songs that resemble more the classic elements of alternative rock and metal, such as Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants (my favorite song of the album) or Unretrofied. After all, I'm just <i>pretending</i>
	to be a music nerd.</p>
	<p>I must also give special mention to the short track Crutch Field Tongs, with its haunting, dreary, industrial atmospheric ambiance, even if short-lived. In general, this is an album that I ultimately had a
	good time listening to, and will probably revisit many of its songs at a later time.</p>
