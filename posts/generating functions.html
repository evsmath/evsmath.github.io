	<h1>A short text on generating functions</h1>
	<p>I was recently motivated to write this small text by the recently uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOXCLR3Wric">video</a> by the legendary mathematics expositor Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) on generating functions.
	Previously, I presented a short seminar on the topic for the undegradute seminar group S4 at IME-USP, drawing inspiration both from the book "generatingfunctionology" by Herbert S. Wilf(mentioned in the above video)
	and the book "21 Aulas de Matemática Olímpica", by Carlos Yuzo Shine. It's intent was to introduce generating functions as a natural tool to employ on problems mainly in combinatorics (hence the suggestive subtitle "Como Algebrizar a Combinatória"),
	drawing from some examples I found especially interesting.</p>
	<p>It is perhaps not that remarkable of a coincidence to find that the video by Grant utilizes examples in a very similar vein to the ones I considered in my seminar, notably the one on the Fibbonaci Numbers being the same.
	This is a testament to the beauty of the theory conceived, and while I would love to expand my perspective on the topic, it is somewhat unnecessary when a clearly better maths communicator, with much better tools at his disposal, has already done what I would
	in a much more comprehensive manner. It is the reason why I, at the present moment, may refrain from rewriting my seminar on a post on this page, but I am still compelled to offer my vision on a specific point mentioned by Grant: the intution and motivation
	behind considering generating functions in the first place. Naturally, this perspective will draw from many references, some of which I may not be able to cite out of memory, but nonetheless influenced me to a great degree.</p>
	<p>
	<p>To me, the primary idea behind considering generating functions in the first place is to properly express algebraically the additive and multiplicative principles in
	combinatorics. The additive principle states that exclusive options and situations are to be considered separately, and hence added together, and the multiplicative 
	principle states that simulteanous options and situations ought to be multiplied together. This is heuristically represented by the following. Consider that I have 3 shirts
	I can wear on a given day, each labeled $A$, $B$ or $C$. My options for that day are therefore represented by the expression
	\[
	A + B + C.
	\]</p>
