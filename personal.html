	<h1>Opinions, Lists and Miscellanea</h1>
	<p>5 Songs I have enjoyed recently:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <em>Locust Star</em> - Neurosis </li>
		<li> <em>Jigsaw Falling Into Place</em> - Radiohead</li>
		<li> <em>New Faces in the Dark</em> - Loathe</li>
		<li> <em>Paranoia Shields</em> - The Dillinger Escape Plan</li>
		<li> <em>Magenta Mountain</em> - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard</li>
	</ul>
	<p> Some math books I recommend: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> <em>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</em> - John M. Lee.
		Comprehensive, detailed and all-around amazing book on everything you need to know in order to start dealing with smooth manifolds. I enjoy such lenghtier expositions, and the language introduced is clear, with many exercises. </li>
		<li> <em>Elliptic Tales</em> - Avner Ash, Robert Gross.
		A panorama of Elliptic Curves and their many facets, dealing with both the algebraic and analytic aspects, it succeeds in generating much interest for the theory presented.</li>
		<li> <em>Complex Analysis</em> - Rolf Busam, Eberhard Freitag.
		Another lenghtier book, it takes plenty of care in properly introducing the fundamental notions of holomorphic functions one should be familiar with. It shows how the theory shines when dealing with elliptic and modular functions, and the many constructions in chapter 4. The illustrations are also incredibly helpful.</li>
		<li> <em>A History of Complex Dynamics</em> - Daniel S. Alexander.
		A great historical context to the developments of complex dynamics, from it's infancy to maturity, while not shying away from the more detailed aspects of the mathematics involved.</li>
		<li> <em>Iteration of Complex Functions</em> - Alan F. Beardon.
		There are several other great introductory books on holomorphic dynamics, such as Milnor's <em>Dynamics in One Complex Variable</em>, and Carleson & Gamelin's <em>Complex Dynamics</em>. </li>
		<li> <em>Mathematics of the 19th Century Volume 2</em> - A. N. Kolmogorov, A. P. Yushkevich. Great book on the historical contexts for the development of the main ideas in geometry and complex analysis in the 19th century, that would give the foundation for most modern formulations of these theories.
		I find it advisable to be first acquainted with differential geoemetry, linear algebra, complex analysis and some classic algebraic geometry, in order to better take in the topics presented.</li>
