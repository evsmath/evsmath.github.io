		<p>Hi! I'm Eduardo Ventilari Sodré, a former undergraduate student at the Mathematics and Statistics Institute of the University of 
	São Paulo (<a href="https://www.ime.usp.br">IME-USP</a>) and prospective grad student at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/">Brown University</a>.</p>
	
		<p>I studied Riemannian Geometry for my senior thesis under <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~gorodski/">Prof. Claudio Gorodski</a>, following the 
		FAPESP project <a href="https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/198948/introducao-a-geometria-riemanniana/">21/10816-4</a>.
		You can check out the thesis <a href="https://bdta.abcd.usp.br/item/003116345">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The list of things I wish to learn more about is extensive. This includes Riemann surfaces, holomorphic dynamics, ergodic theory, 
		complex, symplectic and Kähler geometries, Teichmüller spaces, harmonic analysis, probability, integral geometry and mathematical physics.
		In general, I am deeply interested in geometrical and dynamical phenomena.</p>
		
		<p>I was an organizer of the S4 student seminar group, which aims to present interesting topics and ideas in math to new undergraduate students. 
		Here is a <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCnD6qbtyI52evsW7aFPyVxTPxuSgoz3b">link</a> to past seminars on Youtube, given in portuguese.</p>
	
		<p>Here are some of my <a href="./writings.html">writings</a> on certain math subjects. Most of them are in portuguese, though.
		You can find here a copy of my <a href="./docs/cv.pdf">CV</a>, and also of my <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/2035241964690887">Lattes page</a>.
		These may be slightly outdated.</p>
	
		<p>I like softball, pool, music, cycling and going out for walks.</p>
	
		<p> <a href="./personal.html">Personal links, opinions and assorted information</a>. Here's hoping I don't take myself too seriously.<p/>
